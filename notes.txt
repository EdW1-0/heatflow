Heatflow sim (game?)

Premise:
- A grid of cells representing finite elements. Each has a temperature and interacts with its neighbours.
- Heat should flow through system as it evolves. 

- Will need a table view
- Perhaps just start there.

- 1) Table view of fixed size
- 2) Table view rendered in React, set to fixed size.
- 3) Table view rendered in React, reading size from Flask server (where it is fixed)
